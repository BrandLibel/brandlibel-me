# BrandLibel.me
My personal website built using React.js and Node.js

## Requirements
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org) (I used version 10.16.0)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Install:
- `yarn install`

## Local test build:
This runs the website on `webpack-dev-server`. Instantly see client-side changes without rebuilding. Currently buggy due to BrowserRouter.
- `yarn dev`
- visit `localhost:8080`

## Production build (on port 3000):
- `yarn prod`
